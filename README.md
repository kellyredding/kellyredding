### Hi, I'm Kelly Redding üëç

I love full-stack web development. I prefer using Ruby and Javascript. I have led a development team, architected complex software systems, designed front-end UX, and everything in between.

I play around a lot in Ruby and have written many gems to learn different concepts and play with different API approaches.
